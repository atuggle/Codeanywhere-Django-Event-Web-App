# Django-Startup-Project-Tutorial
### Pro Series - Web Framework Django/python workshop Let's Code Blacksburg! Tuesday, December 13, 2016 from 5:30 PM to 8:00 PM (EST) Blacksburg, VA
##### Updated to use Docker (removed CodeAnywhere)

---

	1. Slide:
		○ Overall Goal of this session:
			§ Demonstrate the value Django can bring inside your organization
				□ By showing how fast and easy it is to spin up a DB driven website
				□ By showing off the autogenerated admin console 
				□ Why Django might be better than a typical CMS (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc)
					® Basically all CMS's will need a programmer to extend and customize and you are still left with a messy customization
					® Django start with a developer and get exactly what you need.
						◊ More quickly get to market window
						◊ Less of what you don't need
			§ Django major features:
				□ Amazing Documentation
				□ Python is easy language to learn and is clean (DRY, TDD, PEP08, etc)
				□ Virtualenv (via python)
				□ Auto generated Admin console
				□ ORM built in (and easy to use)
				□ TDD

---

	2. Slide:
		○ We only have 2 hours so we will be using Docker to spin things up quickly
			§ Allows us to skip python & django installation (since it will be done inside the Docker container)
		○ We will rely heavily on github repo sample pre-built before the class for code snippets

---

	3. Slide:
		○ Ensure Docker is running on your machine
		○ Open gitbash and run the docker command found here
			§ [https://hub.docker.com/r/mchughmk/django-starter](https://hub.docker.com/r/mchughmk/django-starter)
		○ The above command runs a docker container that creates the project and code in a folder on your local machine
			§ CD into your new folder and open up your code
			§ %>code .
			§ %>docker-compose up -d
		○ Navigate to [https://localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000)

---

	4. Slide:
		○ Executing commands inside the container shell:
			§ %>docker-compose exec web bash
					OR
			§ %>docker-compose exec web whoami

---

	5. Slide:
		○ Discuss manage.py
		○ Discuss difference in Projects and Apps in Django
		○ Initial project already created thanks to docker:
		○ See command in docker file
			§  django-admin.py startproject projectname

---

	6. Slide:
		○ I was told there would be a free admin console?
		○ First we must create a super user in the db:
			□ %>docker-compose exec web bash
			□ %> python manage.py createsuperuser
				□ Follow prompts
			□ Navigate to your app /admin:
				□ [https://localhost:8000/admin](https://localhost:8000/admin)
				□ Notice there is already "Groups" & "Users"

---

	7. Slide:
		○ Must create an app inside our Django project.
		○ You can have multiple apps but today we will just have one
			§ %> python manage.py startapp events
		○ SEE branch: release-one-projectapp-creation

---

	8. Slide:
		○ Discuss MVC vs TMV
			§ Django is not true MVC, but it is equally as optimal
			§ Compareing the two:
				□ Template is view
				□ View is controller
				□ Model is model
				□ Urls.py maps the route

---

	9. Slide:
		○ Connect events app to project
			§ Add the below line to the "INSTALLED_APPS" section of the settings.py file
				□ 'events.apps.EventsConfig'
			§ Create events/urls.py:
				from django.conf.urls import url
				from . import views
				app_name = 'events'
				urlpatterns = [
				    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
				    # url(r'^(?P<event_id>[0-9]+)/$', views.detail, name='detail'),
				]
			§ Connect projectname/urls.py to projectname/events/url.py
				from django.conf.urls import include, url
				url(r'^events/', include('events.urls')),
		
---
		
	10. Slide:
		○ Create basic "Hello World" in views.py 
			§ Ensure "HttpResponse" has been imported in the top "from ..." line
			§ Add below code
			def index(request):
			  return HttpResponse('Hello World')
		○ SEE branch: release-2-projectapp-view

---

	11. Slide:
		○ Create Models:
			§ Event(models.Model)
				□ Name
				□ Date_time
				□ Description
				□ Enabled
			§ Person
				□ Name
				□ Email
			§ Attendance
				□ Person
				□ Event
		○ See: [https://github.com/atuggle/Django-Startup-Project-Tutorial/blob/release-3-projectapp-models/projectname/events/models.py](https://github.com/atuggle/Django-Startup-Project-Tutorial/blob/release-3-projectapp-models/projectname/events/models.py)

---

	12. Slide:
		○ Discuss ORM
			§ %> python manage.py makemigrations
			§ %> python manage.py migrate
			§ %> python manage.py migrate 0003 (targeted migration "roll back")
		○ Look at migrations folder
			§ Review 00001_initial.py file it created
		○ SEE branch: release-3-projectapp-models

---

	13. Slide: 
		○ Discuss shell
			§ %> python manage.py shell
			§ >>> from events.models import Event, Person, Attendance
			§ >>> Event.objects.all() 
			§ >>> e = Event(name='event one', description='this is the description')
			§ >>> e.save() 
			§ >>> e.date_time
			§ >>> e = Event(name='event two', description='this is the description for event two')
			§ >>> e.save()
			§ >>> Event.objects.filter(name__endswith='two')  
			§ >>> quit()      <- to quit

	14. Slide:
		○ Create Templates and connect to view:
			§ Discuss why duplication of app name in template folder
			§ events/templates/events/index.html
				□ https://github.com/atuggle/Django-Startup-Project-Tutorial/blob/release-4-projectapp-templates/projectname/events/templates/events/index.html
			§ events/templates/base.html
				□ https://github.com/atuggle/Django-Startup-Project-Tutorial/blob/release-4-projectapp-templates/projectname/events/templates/base.html

			§ Events/static/events/starter-template.css
				□ https://github.com/atuggle/Django-Startup-Project-Tutorial/blob/release-4-projectapp-templates/projectname/events/static/events/starter-template.css

		○ SEE branch: release-4-projectapp-templates

				□ https://github.com/atuggle/Django-Startup-Project-Tutorial/blob/release-5-projectapp-forms/projectname/events/forms.py

		○ Create form and detail.html:
		○ Events/templates/events/details.html
			□ https://github.com/atuggle/Django-Startup-Project-Tutorial/blob/release-5-projectapp-forms/projectname/events/templates/events/detail.html
		○ Uncomment line un urls.py so details route will work
		○ Update views.py to look like this:
			□ https://github.com/atuggle/Django-Startup-Project-Tutorial/blob/release-5-projectapp-forms/projectname/events/views.py
		○ Use the form to create one or more attendance records in db
		○ SEE branch: release-5-projectapp-forms
